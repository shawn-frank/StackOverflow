# UICollectionView grid layout

This solution was developed in response to this [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/76030350/1619193) where the OP wanted to create a grid layout similar to something you would see with TicTacToe. 

This can be achieved using `UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout` to set the width and height of each cell.
